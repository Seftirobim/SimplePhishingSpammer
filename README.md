# SimplePhishingSpammer

SimplePhishingSpammer is a simple automated bot for spamming phishing websites that have a simple login form with 2 inputs: username and password, or it can be customized!

  - Python 3
  - Easy to use
  - Randomly picks username and password from a .txt file
  
## Note

- This script was developed through experimentation, starting from modifying a script generated by chatGPT and incorporating some functions I took from [v3lip](https://github.com/v3lip/PhishingSpammer)


As an example or for trial purposes, I have created a simple PHP form submit file in the `tes_spam` folder.

- Create a database and its tables.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_tespython;

USE db_tespython;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tb_user (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(10),
    password VARCHAR(10)
);
```

## How to use

- First, install Python (if not already installed).
- Run the script. 

```sh
$ python bot.py
```
- Enter the target URL
- If the connection times out or encounters an error, the script will retry after a few seconds until it is successfully connected again (this can be due to our own connection or if the phishing website is temporarily down).

## Installation requirements 

Windows:
```sh
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Linux:
```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
